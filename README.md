# HNL

Here is an example of HNL (long lived particle) production for CLD full simulation and reconstruction.
## Generate HNL
 One needs first to generated HNL events in the hepmc3 format (so including hadronisation). HNL lhe files can be produced with madgraph, following same production as for the FCC HNL analysis in [arXiv:2203.05502v4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05502.pdf). The madgraph parameters can be found at [MG Card](https://github.com/FCC-LLP/FCCAnalyses/blob/master/examples/FCCee/bsm/LLPs/DisplacedHNL/HNL_sample_creation/mg5_proc_card_HNL_Majorana_eenu_50GeV_1p41e-6Ve.dat). 

The madgraph HNL model can be found at the link below. The tgz file has to be unziped within the "models" directory of madgraph.

Generations can be simply be done with the following command :
 
 ```
bin/mg5_aMC mg5_proc_card_HNL_Majorana_eenu_50GeV_1p41e-6Ve.dat
 ```
 Once the generation is done, the hepmc file is produced in the "events" directory of the process directory. It has to be unzipped in a dedicated directory. 

 Then run pythia standalone to produce HEPMC3 file following these [instructions](https://github.com/gaswk/HNL/tree/main/hepmc3).The hepmc file has to be reached by condor, so it has to be either on AFS or EOS.

## Simulation and Reconstruction with CLD FullSim

The simulation can be launch from the script:
```
python ProdSim4Physics.py -Nevts_tot="50000" -Nevts_per_job="1000" \
        -Sample="HNL_Majorana_eenu_50GeV_1p41e-6Ve" \
        -inputFiles="HNL_Majorana_eenu_50GeV_1p41e-6Ve.hepmc" \
        -output_sim="/eos/user/g/gasadows/Output/HNL/SIM"
```
```Nevts_tot``` is the total number of events, ```Nevts_per_job``` is the number of events per job. The number of jobs is determined automatically from ```Nevts_tot``` and ```Nevts_per_job```. ```Sample``` is the sample name, note that it should match the last part of the inputFiles path.

Once the simulation is produced, the reconstruction is done with the script, notes that ```Nevts_tot```, ```Nevts_per_job``` and ```Sample``` **should be the same as for the simulation**
```
python ProdRec4Physics.py -Nevts_tot="50000" -Nevts_per_job="1000" \
        -Sample="HNL_Majorana_eenu_50GeV_1p41e-6Ve" \
        -output_rec="/eos/user/g/gasadows/Output/HNL/REC" \
        -inputFiles="/eos/experiment/fcc/ee/analyses_storage/BSM/HNL_ee/"
```

Sometimes events or outputs are missing, to check that all events have been simulated and reconstructed run again the simulation/reconstruction processes, it will run only the proceses with missing events.
